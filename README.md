# textgame-haskell
A (probably) simple text adventure game written in Haskell

The goal for this project is to get a little bit more experience in a few areas of Haskell.

My goal is to get more familiar with the following aspects of Haskell:

1. The StateT monad transformer (I'm guessing at least a State + IO stack will be required)

2. The Command design pattern or something like an Operational monad for creating my own instruction set for in-game actions.

3. Parsec for more complex user input parsing. A Zork-like parser is ideal.

4. HUnit testing, larger scale programs, and more software related challenges.

more will come
